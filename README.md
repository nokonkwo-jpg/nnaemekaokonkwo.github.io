## Overview

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! This project showcases my portfolio, skills, and contact information using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below you will find instructions on how to set up, customize, and deploy the website.


## Installation & Deployment 📦
- Clone the repository and modify the content of **index.html** according to your requirement.
- Add or remove images from `nokonkwo-jpg.github.io/assets/img/` directory as per your requirement.
- I highly recommend using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) to deploy the website the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, first you need to create a GitHub repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
